          Online Kanda was founded in 2025 by a small group of passionate journalists in Bharatpur, Nepal, who saw a need for a digital-first news platform dedicated to integrity. What started as a small blog has grown into a comprehensive news source, thanks to our dedicated team and the loyal support of our readers.
